# Save the Ocean Memory Card Game

## Description
This is an ocean-themed 16 card game that tests the player's memory. 
- There will be 8 matching pairs.
- The player begins by clicking a card, and that card flips over and remains flipped over until another card is clicked. 
- Once the second card is clicked, if it matches the first card, both cards disappear and you get one point.
